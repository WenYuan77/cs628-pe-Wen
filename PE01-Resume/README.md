# MyResume

# Input
The Resume App does not take direct user input during runtime. Instead, the input is predefined in the program's source code. Specifically, the `Resume.js` file contains hardcoded information about the user's personal details, education background, and project portfolio. Additionally, links to external GitHub repositories are included in the project section, which users can click to view further details.

# Process
The app is a React-based single-page application. When the app is started using `npm start`, React processes the `App.js` file, which imports and renders the `Resume` component. The `Resume` component organizes structured data (name, education, and projects) into visually appealing sections using JSX. Styling is applied via the `Resume.css` file to format and enhance the presentation. The app also includes external links, which are dynamically embedded in the JSX code to allow redirection to GitHub repositories.

# Output
The output is a fully styled, responsive webpage displayed in a browser. The webpage showcases the user's resume, including personal information, education history, and project details, with active hyperlinks for further exploration. The result is a professional, visually appealing digital resume.
