Recipe Finder - Input-Process-Output Analysis

Input

The Recipe Finder application allows users to input data through a user-friendly React interface. Users can:

Add new recipes by entering the recipe name, a list of ingredients (comma-separated), and cooking instructions.

Click on a recipe from the list to view its details.

Delete recipes if they are no longer needed.
The inputs are collected via React forms and sent to the backend API using HTTP requests.

Process

The backend, built with Node.js and Express, processes the incoming requests. When a user submits a recipe, the server:

Receives the request and validates the input.

Stores the recipe in MongoDB Atlas using Mongoose.

Retrieves recipes from the database upon user request.

Allows users to delete recipes by handling DELETE requests.

Output

The output is dynamically displayed on the front-end. Users see:

A list of saved recipes fetched from MongoDB.

Detailed recipe information upon clicking an item.

Confirmation messages when recipes are added or deleted.
This ensures a seamless experience for managing recipes efficiently.
